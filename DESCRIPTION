Description: This package provides function to construct confidence sets for
    linear functionals or subvector of a partially identified parameter defined
    by linear moment inequalities. The confidence set is constructed by
    bootstrapping perturbed linear programming problems that define that define
    the lower and upper bounds of the identified set for the functional of
    interest. The procedure is as described in Cho and Russell (2020, 
    arXiv:1810.03180).
